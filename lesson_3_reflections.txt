WHEN WOULD YOU WANT TO USE A REMOTE REPOSITORY RATHER THAN KEEPING ALL YOUR WORK LOCAL?

Having a local repository makes sense if you're sharing code between multiple machines (even if it's as simple as working between your iPad and your laptop) or multiple users in an organization or a company. In addition, for resume and portfolio purposes, having a remote repository allows you to show off your code for review by others!

WHY MIGHT YOU WANT TO ALWAYS PULL CHANGES MANUALLY RATHER THAN HAVING GIT AUTOMATICALLY STAY UP-TO-DATE WITH YOUR REMOTE REPOSITORY?

Manual pulls might be annoying, but the assumption is that whatever version you have in your remote repository is the version you want people to see (or pull from, if they're cohorts). Just because you've been working on a project doesn't mean that your version perfectly matches what's in the remote repository, and vice versa. Pulling changes when you're still working on something important might mean things get wiped out if you've been working on new features.

DESCRIBE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN FORKS, CLONES, AND BRANCHES. WHEN WOULD YOU USE ONE INSTEAD OF ANOTHER?

A FORK: a copy of someone else's repository on GitHub where you've duplicated and deviated your work from theirs so you can work on it and alter it without affecting their version of the work. A fork is similar to a branch in that it deviates from the original repository, but forks are used on repositories not under your control. Forking is specific to GitHub (or at least much more difficult to do without it), while cloning and branching can be done locally.

A CLONE: a copy of an already-existing repository that doesn't require any changes in permissions (often onto your own machine so you can use and alter the code locally). You can clone other people's repositories, but you can't push your changes to their repositories on GitHub without permission. (You can also clone your own repositories, either to another location on your computer or from your own GitHub repo). 

A BRANCH: an "alternative" timeline of commits that allow you to develop experimental features or settings independent of the repository's main timeline. Branches exist inside repositories, but they allow for multiple simultaneous "heads" in the same way forking and cloning allows for multiple heads to exist.

WHAT IS THE BENEFIT OF HAVING A COPY OF THE LAST KNOWN STATE OF THE REMOTE STORED LOCALLY?

When dealing with changes between a local repo or a branch and the master, it can be useful to go ahead and store the last known state of the remote locally so you can merge to it without overwriting either by accident or causing conflicts. Also, if you're going to be offline for some time, having a local copy of the repo means you can work on it at any point between when you've fetched it and when you'll be available online again -- even if it's changed in that time frame, it'll be much easier to merge changes if you've already taken an earlier state of the merge into account.

HOW WOULD YOU COLLABORATE WITHOUT USING GIT OR GITHUB? WHAT WOULD BE EASIER, AND WHAT WOULD BE HARDER?

Without using git or github, there would need to be some form of version control, and likely it would need to be something that everyone involved can agree upon -- something like Dropbox or emailing, which would also have the benefit of keeping track of files and/or making sure we're all sharing the same code.

It would be easier in that everyone would know what they're doing, but harder in that the changes might not make sense, or differing versions would be harder to keep track of and merge together, and possibly someone would have the most 'up to date' version while the rest of us don't, and waiting on them to propagate the changes would cost time.

Git and GitHub might be tricky to learn at first, but at least you can be reasonably certain there's a working version of the code somewhere in there when you go to fetch it.
